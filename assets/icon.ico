# Placeholder for icon file
# This is a text placeholder - you'll need to replace this with an actual .ico file
# You can create one using tools like:
# - https://www.icoconverter.com/
# - https://convertio.co/png-ico/
# - Or any image editor that supports .ico format
#
# Recommended icon sizes to include in the .ico file:
# - 16x16
